# HodlTracker

A budget tracker for personal finance and budget planning. Currently, the
application is an early alpha.

The codebase is a mess because this is the project where I started writing rust.

The app consists of:
- an engine that manages expenses, cash flows, wallets, etc
- a server that exposes the API
- a telegram bot
- in future a TUI interface
